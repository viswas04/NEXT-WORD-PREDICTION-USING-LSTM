# 🚀 Next Word Predictions using LSTM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Next Word Prediction** using a **Hybrid Model Approach**, combining:
- **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)** for predicting known words.
- **Transformer-based Model** for handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
- **Continuous Learning Mechanism** to improve predictions dynamically.

The system is trained on `metamorphosis_clean.txt` and adapts over time by incorporating new words encountered during predictions.

## 🌟 Features
✅ **BiLSTM for In-Vocabulary Words** - Predicts words present in the dataset.
✅ **Transformer Model for OOV Words** - Generates predictions for unknown words.
✅ **Adaptive Learning** - Stores new words and refines predictions dynamically.
✅ **Hybrid Intelligence** - Combines deep learning models for accuracy.
✅ **User Input Storage** - Enhances dataset with user-generated content.
✅ **Language Filtering** - Ensures predictions remain meaningful and pleasant.
✅ **Pre-trained Model** - Enables efficient and fast predictions.
